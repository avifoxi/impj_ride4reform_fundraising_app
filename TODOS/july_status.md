TODOS -- BEFORE GOING LIVE


	
LONGER TERM TODOS at hourly rate
	- returning rider, re-registration process

	- for paypal credit card errors english language to user facing

	- special rabbi short ride

	- really... all payments should happen in one controller. period. 

AFR suggestions --


DEV priorities, no one will ever notice...
	- refactor javascript 
	- add a little more consistency to naming conventions for various views


DONE
	- admin page -- when admin processes user manually to ride, the modal still says 'going to paypal'
		- ensure that language is different
